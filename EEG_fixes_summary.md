# EEG Machine Learning Model - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Fixed plotting graph error**
**Problem**: The plotting code had multiple issues:
- Missing `seq_len` variable definition
- `.shape()` syntax errors (should be `.shape` without parentheses)
- Missing proper matplotlib figure setup

**Solutions implemented**:
- Added `seq_len = 2549` definition before plotting code
- Fixed all `.shape()` calls to `.shape` 
- Added proper shape display functions with print statements
- Ensured matplotlib is properly imported

### 2. ⚠️ **Improved data loading (Partially Fixed)**
**Problem**: Empty file paths would cause errors when trying to load CSV files

**Solutions implemented**:
- Added proper path handling with example paths
- Added file existence checks before loading
- Created fallback dummy data for testing when real data is unavailable
- Added informative print statements about data loading status

### 3. ✅ **Added model analysis graphs at the end of training**
**Problem**: Missing comprehensive model evaluation and training visualization

**Solutions implemented**:
- Added `plot_training_history(history)` function that plots:
  - Training vs Validation Loss
  - Training vs Validation Accuracy
- Added `plot_model_evaluation(y_true, y_pred, y_pred_proba)` function that shows:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - ROC Curve with AUC score
- Added proper matplotlib figure sizing and layout

### 4. ✅ **Fixed import issues**
**Problem**: Missing or inconsistent imports across cells

**Solutions implemented**:
- Ensured all required libraries are imported:
  - matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  - numpy as np
  - pandas as pd
  - sklearn components
  - tensorflow/keras components
  - imblearn for SMOTE and RandomOverSampler

## Files Modified

- **EEG_on_off (1).ipynb**: Applied all fixes to this notebook

## Remaining Todo Items

The following items from your original todo list still need attention:

2. **Get the data**: 
   - You need to update the file paths to point to your actual EEG data files
   - Calculate the data needed for each time to balance both on and off states

3. **Test the model and adjust the model layers**:
   - Run the model training and evaluate performance
   - Adjust model architecture based on results

5. **Create an app that automatically preprocesses the data**:
   - Select between SMOTE and RandomOverSampler
   - Modify the layers (dropout selection, LSTM vs GRU)
   - Adjust node counts based on overfitting/underfitting

## How to Use the Fixed Code

1. **Update data paths**: Modify the `on_path` and `off_path` variables with your actual file paths
2. **Run the notebook**: The plotting errors should now be resolved
3. **Use analysis functions**: After training, call:
   ```python
   plot_training_history(history)
   plot_model_evaluation(y_test, y_pred, y_pred_proba)
   ```

## Testing with Dummy Data

The notebook now includes dummy data generation if your actual data files are not found, so you can test the entire pipeline without having the real data files first.

## Next Steps

1. Upload your actual EEG data files to the specified paths
2. Run the notebook to test the fixes
3. Evaluate model performance and adjust architecture as needed
4. Consider implementing the automated preprocessing app mentioned in todo item 5
